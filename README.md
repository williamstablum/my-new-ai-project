# Ai in healthcare

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project is about how Ai can be at help for when someone is sick or has rashes of different kinds. The ai platform/app can then identify the picture that the sick person is taking and then come up with a conclusion of what the problem is. If the sick person needs more help from real people or if it's just a mosquito bite for example.  


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* The first problem is that in sweden at least the medical sector is understaffed and with the help of ai that can just say what is wrong with the person we can take away the identification part directly and just focusing on treatment. 
* This app or ai can also be used for people that just want someone to talk to and tell them about their day. 
* My personal motivation for solving this problem is that it's just takes too long time to wait for getting help when you are sick. It needs to be quicker and with the help of ai it can.
* This is an intresting and important topic because we can streamline the whole medical process with this. Make it more efficient. 


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?
This can be used in hospitals but mostly through home via an app on you mobile device. The users are you and me. 


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
The data would come from different patient records that's been in the past and different kinds of diseases and pictures of rashes and so on. And through time the Ai would have built up an own server with lots of data from lots of people. 

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?
The big question is how to get all the information of the different diseases and from different people. We can't just take data from the hospitals servers, or can we? 

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on? 
It can be used by hospitals and then used by everyone so you don't even have to go to the hospital to get checked on. You can just do everything through an app.
